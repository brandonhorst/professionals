# Professionals

You have assembled your team. They are the very best at what they do. Perhaps you have a soldier, or a plumber, or a wrestler, or a knight, or a model, or a quarterback, or a manager, or a warlord, or a necromancer, or a newscaster, or a lion tamer, or even (if you're lucky) a programmer.

You need to utilize their unique skills to take down your equally-diverse opponents the only way that true professionals know how: a fight to the death.

This is (the beginning stages of) an Final Fantasy Tactics-style turn-based strategy RPG, but without any dumb grinding and with a butt-ton more diversity. Check it out (currently only available locally).

## Development

`Professionals` is entirely open source, written entirely in JavaScript, and runs standalone in any browser. Logic with [`redux`](http://redux.js.org/). View with [`deku`](http://dekujs.github.io/deku/). Written using ES2015 features and JSX, compiled with [`babel`](https://babeljs.io/) and [`browserify`](http://browserify.org/). If you want to get involved, read [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) and start writing code!

This could be a really good way to get to know JavaScript, Redux, Deku, functional programming, predictable state, declarative interfaces, or just familiarize yourself with Open Source Software in general. Learn in a fun, no-stakes environment!

This is strictly a hobby. While I think it's a cool idea, it may never actually become a fully-realized game.

## Installation

```sh
npm install
npm run build
open index.html #or whatever on Windows
