Adding new jobs or activites is pretty easy, because they are just composed of other pieces.

Adding new low-level features (like `activityEffects`, `activityRanges`, `statuses`, etc.) are a bit harder because they will require writing some code. But they're not super complicated.

Adding new game mechanics entirely is harder, but it's still just Redux. Give it a shot.

Keep it classy and thematic.

We are going to want Artwork at some point. If you have an eye for design and know anything about vector graphics, make yourself known!

Use `npm run watch` for development.

Add tests for any new features.

Have fun with it and learn something.
